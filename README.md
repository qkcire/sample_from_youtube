# Sample From Youtube

The purpose of this script is to make it easier to obtain musical samples from YouTube.

## How it works:
  ./sample_from_youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybfQRvl5r-I

After some time, the script should output a file of the sample in .wav format.

If you happen to use this, I encourage you to manipulate it to fit your needs.
